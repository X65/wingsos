Assembling and compiling
------------------------

Make sure that the following are ready to go:
	
	lcc
	pucrunch
	prmain - for sending and serial line
	
Then do a make in this dir.

If everything worked, the file jos.d64 should be a 1571 image with the 
everything on it. To run, load and run the file "booter".

If you want to use linux as a 1541 or 1571 plus serial line, you can do:

make asend4 - sends booter and attaches prmain to ptyp4

(all drives need to be disabled before these two)
make asend  - same as above but without loading up drive dos's
make asend2 - leaves prmain attached to current console

If you want to use the serial line, you will need ptyp4 set up with some 
sort of command for ppp such as:

pppd nodetach ptyp4 local 192.168.0.1:192.168.0.2 passive debug
