          Welcome to WiNGS!
----------------------------------------

Ok before you doing anything, it's handy
to know that you have access to more
than one screen (console) at a time. Not
only do you have access to more than one
screen, through the power of
multitasking, each screen can have
programs running at the same time as the
other screens. The console drivers are
set to contain four different "virtual
consoles", which you can switch between
using c= + 1,2,3,4. You can also switch
to an 80 column console with c= +
BACKARROW.

Here's just a quick guide to the shell
and some of the commands you can use
basically the same as using a UNIX
shell such as bash.

cd [dir]      - change dir

ls            - list directories
ls -l         - list dir 
                with full information

mem           - show how much free 
                memory there is

ps            - show all running
                processes

si            - show system information

cat [files..] - display a file

more [file..] - display files page at a
		time

Be careful with the following commands!
If you don't know what your doing, you
might accidently delete or wipe over 
stuff. I suggest reading up about them
in a unix tutorial if you've never come
across them.

rm [file1] [file2]
              - remove files
cp [file1] [file2] ... [dir]
              - copy files
mv [file1] [file2]
              - renames file1 
                to file2
mv [file1] [file2] ... [dir]
              - move files

The shell allows the use of
wildcards, (* and ?), and also has the
feature of filename completion. For
example if you typed:

cat hel{CTRL}

The shell would look through the current
directory and look for all files that
start with "hel", and if there was only
one would finish the command off for
you. For example if there was just a
file called help.txt you would end up
with:

cat help.txt

If there were more than one file
starting with "hel", it would do
nothing, but if you pressed CTRL again
it would give you a list of all the
files beginning with "hel". 

This is an extremely handy feature to
have! It takes a lot of the pain out of
typing commands.

The shell can also use pipes to link
programs together. For example:

ls | more

Will link the output of ls to the input
of more, which displays text one page at
a time.

Also output and input can be redirected
to files with the > and < characters.
E.G.

ps > procs.txt

Will save the process list to the file
"procs.txt".

The shell has a 10 line history, 
which means that if you want see the 
commands you previous entered, you 
can go through them with CRSR UP/DOWN.

That's about all for the shell, if you
want to learn more, look up "unix shell
tutorial" somewhere on the internet. The
WiNGS shell isn't a full UNIX shell, as I
simply want it to be used for entering
commands, not writing scripts.
		
In WiNGS most keys are mapped how they are
in terminal programs, but some keys are
different.. This is under review! :)

CTRL -> TAB
So when you press CTRL to finish
commands your actually pressing TAB.

C= -> CTRL
Pressing C=+C to kill a process is
actually pressing CTRL+C.

BACK ARROW -> ESC

RUNSTOP -> CTRL+C

Use this in the shell to stop a program.

The pipe character "|" is obtained by
pressing SHIFT and the pound key.

There will be more keys added or
remapped in the future...

----------------------------------------
           Getting on the net
----------------------------------------

At the moment it's a bit of a pain to
get onto the net if you need to dial
out, because you have to do it manually.
First of all do a "ps" and make sure
that tcpip.drv and uart.drv are loaded,
and if not, load them.

Then to dial out do:

term [-b baudrate] /dev/modem

Which will attach you to the modem so
you can type commands e.g.
atz
atdt24324324

Once your connected, you'll either need
to start ppp by waiting for the prompts
for username and password, or, if ppp is
started automatically on your isp, hit
Run-Stop and run ppp (using pap):

ppp /dev/modem username password

You have to type that quite quickly, or
you could make a very simple shell
script to do it for you.

#! sh
ppp /dev/modem user password

Then all you would need to type is "pp".

It's a bit long winded, but eventually
there will of course be a gui dialer
program, and connecting will be a matter
of a simple click.

To end a ppp session, use:

poff

To get statistics on any TCP connections
you may have open, or stats on the ppp
interface use the command:

netstat

If you're lucky enough to get on the
internet with WiNGS:

irc /tcp/server:port ircnick 
              - speaks for itself
telnet address port 
              - telnet somewhere else!

httpd [dir]   - start a web server
                serving from that dir
		
telnetd       - start up a telnet server

----------------------------------------
Other stuff you can do with WiNGS:

josmod [-h hertz] file.mod [file.s3m]
[file.xm]

Play mod files! For example to play your
entire mod collection you can do:

josmod *.mod

--------
wavplay file.wav

Plays a PCM type wav.
--------

rawplay [-h hertz] [-b bits] [-s] file

Play raw samples

--------
stars

Displays a simple starfield. Use C= +
BACKARROW to get back to the shell.
--------
web file.html

Display a html file, 
--------
wc [file]

Count the words in a file.
--------
echo anything

Echo's parameters to screen
--------
memchk

Disaply all memory blocks
--------
reset

Resets the machine, careful doesn't
close applications or write out
unwritten files!
--------
gui

Load the GUI! This is a simple shell
script to load the gui and also loads
ajirc the graphical IRC client. If you
can't use the internet you can at least
have a little fiddle, moving and
resizing, with this app. The
foundations are their for a very
powerful environment.

Once again you can use C= + BACK ARROW
to switch between the gui and all the
other processes that use the VIC.

----------------------------------------
IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE!!!!!!!!!
----------------------------------------

DO NOT just turn the computer off after
a program has quit, because WiNGS uses a
delayed write cache, and if data may not
be written out to disk yet. Always wait
for AT LEAST 3 seconds of no disk
activity before turning off. Eventually
WiNGS will have something similar to
CTRL-ALT-DEL on PC, which will start
shutting WiNGS down and tell you when it's
safe to turn off.

Also WiNGS hasn't been fully tested yet,
so avoid using it with crucial data! I
take no responsibility if it screws up
your files!

WiNGS doesn't deal save out last modified
times with files yet, but that will come
in the future.

The disk cache handler does a really bad
job of deciding which order blocks
should be written out. So if your
writing files, your drive head may move
back and forward in a crazy fashion!
This will of course be fixed at a later
date.
