No. Matches aren't done by string, but by each path component, and have to
be exact in the path component match. Since "dev" != "device.txt" the open
would be sent to the owner of "/".

"/dev/shm" would go to Dev (who would say ENOENT), but "/dev/shmem" would go
to Proc.

Essentially the library goes to the owner of "/dev",
which is Dev, and does an opendir(),readdir() sequence to get stat info on
all the files that Dev has inside "/dev". Dev returns stat info
on ser1,null,pty*, etc.

Then the library searches for any prefixes which match /dev/X,
finds the manager that owns "/dev/X" and stats X
(for instance /dev/hd0 may be found, and stat() will be requested of
Fsys, and /dev/shmem will be found, and stat() will be requested of
Proc).

I don't know the details of how the library does this, but I do know that
when you write a server, you don't have to worry about it. You just attach
your prefix as /dev/hello_world, respond to stat requests, and hello_world
shows up with the permissions, etc, that you replied to the stat request with.
