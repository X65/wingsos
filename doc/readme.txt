This is a demonstration of JOS, a 
multitasking environment for the 
SuperCPU.

What you can do in this demo:
Switch you virtual console with C= and
1-4. Each console has it's own shell,
so you can run 4 commands at once. 
(Unfortunately none of the programs
run long enough to demonstrate this!)

Each of the programs in this demo
is written in C and compiled with 
LCC 65816.

Anyway Have fun and read my homepage
for full details of this demo.
